Things to be done for keyboard_draw

Properly space letters (text)

Correctly backup size change undo
This is especially visible in clear command

Change keyboard display to indicate text input.

Make Shift change display case and not display "Sh".

Better resize key display images.  When keyboard is expanded, the
images should be as large as possible within the key square.
